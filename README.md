# ScalaSudokuSolver

A sudoku solver written in Scala!


## Building

The project is built using buildr (http://buildr.apache.org/). In order to correctly build you will need modify the buildfile to point your JAVA_HOME to an appropriate Java install. This Java install should have the same bitadness as your Ruby version (at least if you're using JRuby), otherwise buildr will freak out.

## Running

The project can be run with "buildr run"
